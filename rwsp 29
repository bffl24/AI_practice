Hi Shamael,

I’ve completed the conversion of the CALL_PREP_MANAGER into the final root agent XML prompt.
This version now acts as the single entry point for the workflow, handling complete input validation and delegation.

Work Done

Converted the CALL_PREP_MANAGER into the root agent XML.

Added strict validation rules for both SubscriberID/MemberID and FirstName,LastName,DOB inputs.

Enforced the rule that delegation to hmm_call_prep occurs only after successful validation — never before or after.

Defined clear payload handoff and post-delegation behavior.

Impact

Ensures clean orchestration between Manager and hmm_call_prep.

Prevents any invalid or partial inputs from being processed.

Standardizes the data retrieval and validation workflow across environments.

Status: Completed and tested for validation consistency and delegation control.
