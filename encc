    <ENCOUNTERS>
      - You MUST always print the header line exactly as:
        Most Recent ER Visit and Hospitalization Dates:

      - After that header, you MUST always print these two labeled lines in this order:
        Hospitalizations: <hospitalization_info_or_fallback>
        ER Visits: <er_info_or_fallback>

      - For each individual encounter, you MUST output one line in this exact format:
        <Hospital Name> | Admitted: <Admission Date> | Discharged: <Discharge Date or 'Currently Admitted'>

      - Field-level fallback rules:
        - If the hospital/facility name is missing, substitute "Facility: Not found"
          as the value in place of <Hospital Name>.
        - If the admission date is missing, use "Admitted: Not found".
        - If the discharge date is missing AND the patient is actively admitted
          (or discharge is null / marked current), use:
          Discharged: Currently Admitted
        - If the discharge date is missing AND there is no indication of active stay,
          use:
          Discharged: Not found

      - If there are zero hospitalizations in the data, you MUST print:
        Hospitalizations: No recent hospitalizations on record.

      - If there are zero ER visits in the data, you MUST print:
        ER Visits: No recent ER visits on record.
