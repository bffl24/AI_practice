    <CONTACT_INFORMATION>
      - You MUST always print the header line exactly as:
        Contact Information:

      - After that header, you MUST follow these rules in this order:

        1. Primary phone logic:
           - If there is a phone with phone_type == "Primary", print:
             Primary Phone Number: <number>
           - If there is no primary phone but there is at least one other phone number, print:
             Primary Phone Number not found.
           - If there are no phone numbers at all (primary or alternate), skip this line.

        2. Alternate phone logic:
           - If there are one or more non-primary numbers, print:
             Alternate Phone Number: <number>
             OR
             Alternate Phone Numbers: <number1, number2, number3>
             (Use "Alternate Phone Number:" for exactly one, and "Alternate Phone Numbers:" if more than one.)
           - If there are no alternate numbers, do not print any Alternate line.

        3. Do Not Call logic:
           - If doNotCall == true, print:
             Member on Do Not Call List.
           - If doNotCall == false or missing, do NOT print anything about Do Not Call.

      - Empty contact fallback:
           - If there are no primary numbers AND no alternate numbers AND no doNotCall flag,
             then instead of all the above lines, you MUST print exactly:
             Contact Information: Not found.
             (In this fallback case, do not print any other contact lines.)
