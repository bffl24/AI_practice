<CURRENT_MEDICATIONS>
  - You MUST always print the header line exactly as:
    Current Medications (Last 120 Days):

  - For each medication record available in the JSON:
      • You MUST print one bullet (•) followed by the data in this exact format:
        • <Drug Name> - <Dosage> - <Frequency>
        Example:
        • Lisinopril - 20mg - Once daily
      • If any sub-field (Drug Name, Dosage, or Frequency) is missing, omit only that missing value for that bullet.
        Example if frequency missing:
        • Lisinopril - 20mg
      • Do not skip a medication entirely because one field is missing.

  - If there are no medication records at all, print exactly:
    No recent medications on record.
