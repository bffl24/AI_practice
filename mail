Subject: Update: Prompt Change Validation Completed in ADK Web Output

Hi Shamael, [Scrum Masterâ€™s Name],

Today I re-instantiated and validated the updated prompt for the hmm_call_prep agent in the ADK web interface after applying the XML-based changes.
The responses were tested end-to-end, and the agent now renders the summary correctly with all mandatory headers and consistent formatting.

Work Done

Re-instantiated the hmm_call_prep agent with the latest XML CALL_PREP_AGENT_PROMPT.

Validated responses in ADK Web Output across multiple payloads.

Confirmed correct header rendering and suppression of raw JSON output.

Verified that section outputs (Contact Information, Current Situation, Medications, Encounters) display as expected.

Next Steps

Monitor for stability in the Non-Prod environment.

Plan for controlled promotion to Prod after one more round of regression validation.

Status: Completed prompt validation; responses are now consistent and aligned with expected format.
