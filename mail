Subject: Update: XML Prompt Enhancements and Validation in ADK Web Output

Hi Shamael, [Scrum Master’s Name],

Today I re-instantiated and validated the updated XML prompt for the hmm_call_prep agent in the ADK web interface after applying recent changes.
The agent is now rendering complete, consistent summaries across all sections with accurate headers and fallback handling.

Work Done

Updated the Contact Information section in the XML prompt.

Covered and validated all six contact information scenarios (Primary/Alternate phone, Do Not Call, and missing data cases).

Applied minor tweaks to improve ER Visit and Pharmacy (medications) output formatting.

Re-instantiated and validated the updated prompt via ADK Web Output.

Confirmed consistent rendering of mandatory headers and suppression of raw JSON.

Verified correct fallbacks for missing data and alignment with the expected output structure.

Next Steps

Monitor Non-Prod stability after XML prompt updates.

Proceed with a final regression pass before Prod promotion.

Status: XML prompt enhancement and validation completed — all sections (Contact, ER Visits, and Pharmacy) are performing as expected.

Best,
